I am a researcher at Institut Pasteur in Paris, working on applications machine learning and image analysis for bioimaging. I received the Ph.D. degree in ECE from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville (USA). From 2015 to 2018, I worked in the research R&D for General Electric Global Research.

I am an image and data analysis scientist working on bioimage informatics at the Institut Pasteur, Paris. I am a member of the [Bioimage Analysis Laboratory](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.pasteur.fr%2Fen%2Fteam%2Fbioimage-analysis%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGpJj9hsS7B13fK6ttcSjKou_sRXA) led by Dr. Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin. I received a Ph.D. in image analysis from the University of Virginia in 2015 under the supervision of [Dr. Scott T. Acton](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.virginia.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fscott-t-acton&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFOTc_SRZp4uc3v5vAUqBLdc0NW6w), with a focus on developing automatic tools for analyzing microscopy images. From 2015 to 2018, I was a lead scientist at General Electric Global Research Lab, where I worked on machine learning and deep learning based applications for the healthcare industry. I led a team of researchers to conceptualize and develop the first AI based fully automated tool for analysis of fetal health via three dimensional ultrasound.

My current interest spans the field of image analysis and machine learning, with an emphasis on problems such as variational modeling, deep learning, and statistical pattern analysis. I am particularly interested in developing statistical tools for analyzing the interplay between molecules and cells imaged via traditional or super-resolution microscopy.
