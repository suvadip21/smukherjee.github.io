I am a researcher at Institut Pasteur in Paris, working on applications machine learning and image analysis for bioimaging. I received the Ph.D. degree in ECE from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville (USA). From 2015 to 2018, I worked in the research R&D for General Electric Global Research.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
